# Epidemiology

This repository contains simulations regarding the Corona pandemic. Most of the simulations are based on the SIR-model. 
A few simulations go beyond this model by simple modifications: 
- inclusion of vaccinations and the possibility of reinfections (see [here](https://github.com/psm89/Epidemiology/tree/master/Maths_of_Corona_Pandemic/SIRS_model_with_vaccinations))
- inclusion of vaccinations and regulation of the dynamics via shutdowns (see [here](https://github.com/psm89/Epidemiology/tree/master/Maths_of_Corona_Pandemic/Lockdown_model_with_vaccinations))

There are also [Introductory Notes](https://github.com/psm89/Epidemiology/blob/master/Maths_of_Corona_Pandemic/Introductory_notes.pdf) explaining the basic concepts of such epidemiological models using high school maths.

The [Archive](https://github.com/psm89/Epidemiology/tree/master/Archive) contains some first attempts of modelling the pandemic at an earlier stage of this private project.
