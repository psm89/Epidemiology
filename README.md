# Epidemology

This repository contains simulations of the dynamics of viruses spreading among a population. 
There are various approaches and mathematical models in epidemology that have been developed in the past decades. 

Any Jupyter notebook of this repository addresses one of such models. The notebooks are roughly structured as follows: 
1) Brief introduction to the mathematical model and its assumptions. 
2) Step by step development of the code to implement the model. 
3) If possible, quick checks on the consistency of the implementation with analytical results of the mathematical model. 

The number of notebooks in this repository may increase with time.
